## Why was I punished?
For information regarding a punishment occurred, visit the <a href="https://bans.kzg.gg" target="_blank">Killzone Gaming SourceBans</a>. 

For the best results visit the <a href="https://steamid.kzg.gg" target="_blank">Killzone Gaming Steam ID Finder</a> and input your **Steam URL** or **Steam ID** in the field.

After entering in your **Steam URL** or **Steam ID** you will see **SourceBans Lookup** and **SourceComms Lookup**, click the corresponding links to view your **Bans** or **Communications** Blocks.

## How do I appeal a punishment?
To make an appeal you need to sign up / sign in to the <a href="https://kzg.gg/forum" target="_blank">Killzone Gaming Forums</a>. Once that is done, visit <a href="https://kzg.gg/forum/forms/28-unban-unmute-apppeal/" target="_blank">Appeals</a>.

There is a <a href="#">Appeals Guide</a> that can assist with the process.

## How long will the appeal process take?
The appeal process can take anywhere up to 1-2 weeks depending on the availability of the staff team reviewing it.

## Who will review my appeal?
The staff team that reviews the appeals is the **Head Administrator**'s and **Manager**'s of the server group you are appealing for. 

However, the **Management** team might also be involved.

## Why was I banned for Duplicate account?

Duplicate account bans occur because your **IP Address** is linked to a banned user.

If you have a **VPN** active, disabling the **VPN** should remove the ban.

If this does not resolve your issue, you will need to make an <a href="https://kzg.gg/forum/forms/28-unban-unmute-apppeal/" target="_blank">appeal</a>.

## How do I appeal a punishment less than a week?
Punishments less than a week can be resolved through a **CS:GO** <a href="https://discord.com/channels/336784653346406406/563647399596130304" target="_blank">Support</a> ticket. 

After a conclusion is reached, you may need to create an <a href="https://kzg.gg/forum/forms/28-unban-unmute-apppeal/" target="_blank">appeal</a>.

## My appeal was denied, what do I do now?
All denied appeals must wait <strong>3 months</strong> before making a new appeal *(or until the punishment expires)*. If new evidence is provided **AFTER** an appeal is denied, it will **NOT** be taken into consideration until the next appeal.
