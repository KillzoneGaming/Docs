## How do I report a player?
To report a player in-game, first use the `!calladmin` command *in game*. If a player persists, make a **CS:GO** <a href="https://discord.com/channels/336784653346406406/563647399596130304" target="_blank">Support</a> ticket. **Evidence is required**.

## How do I report a staff member?

Report Staff Tickets are seen and dealt with the relevant **Head Administrator** or **Manager** of the Staff member's server group.
