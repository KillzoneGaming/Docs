## What servers does Killzone Gaming have?
To view our servers, head over to <a href="#" target="_blank">#servers</a> in our <a href="https://kzg.gg/discord" target="_blank">Community Discord</a>.

Alternatively, you can also check out the <a href="#" target="_blank">Servers</a> page on our <a href="https://kzg.gg/forum" target="_blank">Forums</a>.

## I can't find a server, what do I do?
Sometimes after a CS:GO update, our servers will go down for a period of time. If a server is not up within 6 hours of an update reach out in our <a href="https://kzg.gg/discord" target="_blank">Community Discord</a>.

Please keep an eye on <a href="#" target="_blank">#announcements</a> in our <a href="https://kzg.gg/discord" target="_blank">Community Discord</a>.

## A server is not working as intended, what do I do?
Please use `!calladmin` or `!report` *in game* if it's related to a map issue *(not changing)*. Otherwise, make a **CS:GO** <a href="https://discord.com/channels/336784653346406406/563647399596130304" target="_blank">Support</a> ticket.

## I purchased a Skill Surf Private Server, what now?
Please make a **Private Surf** <a href="https://discord.com/channels/336784653346406406/563647399596130304" target="_blank">Support</a> ticket. Although private servers are *prioritized*, any critcal bugs will be resolved first to ensure the server can run *smoothly*.
